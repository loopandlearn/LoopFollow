## Loop Follow 

Using so many different apps as a parent or caregiver of a T1D can be very cumbersome. Add in the extra details from Looping
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between apps. Each app has different strengths and weaknesses.
- Spike is great for alarms. 
- Spike and Sugarmate are great for the calendar complication on Apple Watch. 
- Nightscout X or Nightscout in Safari are needed for intricate details from NS.
- IFTTT and Pushover are  needed for Not Looping alerts

And there are some functions I've always wished for and not found anywhere such a one-time temporary alert
for those nights when Loop is stuck on high and you open loop with a correction. This lets you set a higher
low alert for the BG you want to wake up to and close Loop.

Special thanks to Spike-App, NSApple, and Nightguard for helping me figure out how to do a lot of the code for this.

If you want to contribute, the biggest needs today are to make the code cleaner and more efficient, get some major details like Bolus/Basal graph and mg/DL vs mmol added, and create the basis for a watch app.
