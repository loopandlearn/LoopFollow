## Loop Follow 
![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38429455/93782187-436e8880-fbf8-11ea-8709-e2afba692132.png)

### Purpose:

Using so many different apps as a parent or caregiver of a T1D can be very cumbersome. Add in the extra details from Looping
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between apps. Each app has different strengths and weaknesses.
- Spike is great for alarms. 
- Spike and Sugarmate are great for the calendar complication on Apple Watch. 
- Nightscout X or Nightscout in Safari are needed for intricate details from NS.
- IFTTT and Pushover are  needed for Not Looping alerts.

And there are some functions I've always wished for and not found anywhere such a one-time temporary alert
for those nights when Loop is stuck on high and you open loop with a correction. This lets you set a higher
low alert for the BG you want to wake up to and close Loop.

### Building Options

Please see [Loop and Learn: Loop Follow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/) for all the building options.

With the release of version 2.1.0, there is now an easy option for building up to three instances of the Loop Follow app for multiple Loopers in your family. Each instance can be configured to have the display name you choose with these names being the default:

* LoopFollow
* LoopFollow_Second
* LoopFollow_Third

#### Display Name Updates

The _display_name_ is found in a single file.

* Suggestion if you customize the name: use LF {unique name} so you can find the apps easily in iOS Settings screen

Summary instructions by build method:

* Browser Build: 
    * Fork and setup the repository for each Loop Follow instance you want to use: 
        * https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow
        * https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow_Second
        * https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow_Third
    * Commit the desired _display_name_ in the LoopFollowDisplayNameConfig.xcconfig file of your forked repository for LoopFollow, LoopFollow_Second or LoopFollow_Third
* Mac-Xcode Build
    * First build with script, you will be prompted to enter the desired _display_name_
    * This _display_name_ is used each time you select a fresh download for LoopFollow 1, 2 or 3
    * To modify the _display_name_ for subsequent script builds, edit the appropriate file in the ~/Downloads/BuildLoopFollow folder
        *  LoopFollowDisplayNameConfig.xcconfig 
        *  LoopFollowDisplayNameConfig_Second.xcconfig 
        *  LoopFollowDisplayNameConfig_Third.xcconfig 

#### Updates

When modifications and versions are updated, there might be a slight delay for getting the second and third forks updated as well, so if you are using this feature, wait until all three repositories are updated.

### General feature list

Please review the list on [Loop and Learn: Loop Follow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/) which may be updated more frequently than this README.md file.

Each time a release is made, the features added or bugs fixed are found at [Loop Follow Releases](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases).

Each of the features below is selectable - you decide whether to use them.  Additionally, many features are adjustable because YDMV (your diabetes may vary).

1. Scrollable/scalable graph display with BG, IOB, COB, Basal, Bolus, and the General Nightscout Care portal info
    * Supports Glucose display when Dexcom is available but Nightscout is not
    * Supports Loop and iAPS when Nightscout URL is provided and Download Loop/iAPS data is enabled (show Nightscout Settings to see the enable slider)
        * Loop: Loop status, Loop Prediction
        * iAPS: iAPS status, iAPS Prediction lines, Autosens
2. Tap on Alarms on Toolbar to configure.
    * Override DND (Do Not Disturb) and system volume for all alerts with a Snooze All Until and a Mute All Until
    * List of Alarms covers the standard high/low/rise/fall/urgent glucose but also include alerts for missed glucose readings, if below configured glucose, IOB, COB, Not Looping, Overrides, Pump, Missed Bolus, SAGE, CAGE and Battery
    * Each Alarm has configurable settings including Sound selection, PreSnooze (set to be quiet At Night, During Day or Never) and Snooze Until
3. Calendar entries (displayed on watch and/or carplay at 5 minute intervals) pre-formatted with two lines that the user can modify:
    * BG, arrow, delta,  MINAGO (minutes ago for reading)
    * COB, IOB, Basal (U/hr)
4. Background silent audio is played to keep iOS from killing the app; this trick is why it can’t go into the App Store for a simple download and why Loop Follow puts an extra load on the phone battery
5. Badge displays the current BG value on the app icon
6. Information Display Settings allows user to configure the items selected and their order for the right panel when Nightscout URL is provided
    * IOB, COB, Basal, Override, Battery, Pump, SAGE, CAGE, (Recommended) Rec. Bolus, (Glucose Eventually) Pred., Carbs today (Loop and iAPS)
    * Autosens (iAPS only)
7. Pull down on the glucose value to force a refresh from Nightscout (iPhone only - does not work on Mac)
8. When adding a Nightscout site, NS Status says "Checking", "Site Not Found", "Token Required", "Invalid Token", or "OK"
9. New with v2.1.2: Multiple Loopers (up to 3) are easily supported with either Browser Build or Mac-Xcode build
10. New with v2.1.2: The app name (displayed on phone) can be customized when building
    * If enabled, that custom name will be displayed on the main Loop Follow display

### Open Source DIY
- This is a DIY open source project that may or may not function as you expect. You take full responsibility for building and running this app and do so at your own risk.

## Versions

We added version numbers to Loop Follow. Typically the main branch and dev branch are at the same version, but when work is underway, the dev branch may have different code, which we try to indicate with a different version number.

The versioning is:

* major.minor.micro
* For example our first version is 2.0.0

For the most part, the deveopers keep main and dev branches at the same level. But sometimes we want to combine several PR or keep a modification in dev for additional testing.

## For Developers

> * If you are interested in assisting with this app and want to work on new features and improvements for Loop, iAPS and Nightscout functionality, please reach out. 
> * Issues and Pull Requests in GitHub are monitored and will get a response. 

New PR are directed to the dev branch. If you direct one to main, we will move it to point to dev. So always start with your code aligned with dev.

After a PR is merged to dev, the repository maintainers will bump up the verion number before merging to main - please do not modify the version in your branch.

#### Version Updates

Only the maintainers for Loop Follow will update version numbers. This is done by incrementing the LOOP_FOLLOW_MARKETING_VERSION in Config.xcconfig file.
